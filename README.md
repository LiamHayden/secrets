# Secrets
The Secrets project was designed using the *Ruby on Rails* framework (version 7.0.4) and *Bootstrap 5*. 
It allows a user to create a post consisting of a *title* and *content*. Once posted these *secrets* will display on the home page, however only a signed in user will be able to see the creators username.

# Skills Demonstrated
During this project I demonstrated my knowledge of Ruby on Rails *active record associations*, *authentication*, and *controller actions*.
